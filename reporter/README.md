## General info
The Reporter is keeping track of trades held by each account and the ones
that are ready to buy. Allowing users to trade stocks manually or by using bot. 
Provides api for other microservices in network. 

## API documentation TODO not implemented
Documentation for API can found at this endpoints after running container:

- `/docs/` : Documentation endpoint 

## Setup

1 Install Docker

2 Adjust environment variables in [.env](config/environment_variables/.env)

You can check this by
```
    echo $UID
```
4 Build images (*all commands should be done in project root directory)
```
    docker-compose build
```
5 Run containers
```
    docker-compose up
```

## Develop Setup

To create DB with random data use follow command:
```
    docker-compose exec app flask development_utils create_new_develop_db_with_random_data
``` 
## Tests
```
    docker-compose run --rm app make full_test_code
```

## Code format
