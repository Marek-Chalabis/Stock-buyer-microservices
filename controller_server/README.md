## General info
The controller is keeping track of positions held by each account got from the aum server
When new fill come in it divides the stocks so that each account has an overall position 
that matches the split from aum server, then sends this data to the position server in intervals.

## Setup

1 Install Docker

2 Adjust environment variables in [.env](config/environment_variables/.env)

3 Change USER_ID arg in [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) if your local UID is different then 1000, this will fix local file permissions.

You can check this by
```
    echo $UID
```
4 Build images (*all commands should be done in project root directory)
```
    docker-compose build
```
5 Run containers
```
    docker-compose up
```
